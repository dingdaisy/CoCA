# CoCA: Cooperative Component Analysis for Unsupervised Learning with Multi-view Data

Cooperative component analysis (CoCA) is a new statistical framework for unsupervised learning with multiple data views. Our framework provides a continuum of models that encompass Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) at the two ends of the solution path. From this framework, users can select the best model that **captures significant within-view variance and strong cross-view correlation** in a data-adaptive manner. Additionally, we introduce a sparse variant of the method (sparse CoCA), which incorporates the Lasso penalty to identify key features driving observed patterns.
